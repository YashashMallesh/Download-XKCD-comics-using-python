This program helps you to:
1. Load XKCD home page
2. Saves comic image on that page
3. Follows previous Comic link
4. Repeats until it reaches first comic.

A multithreaded program that has some threads downloading comics while others are establishing connections and writing the comic image files to disk uses your internet connection very efficiently and downloads the comics more quickly.
